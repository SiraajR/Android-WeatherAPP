# Android-WeatherAPP
This is code written in Android Studio for my first Android app development project.
The app takes in the desired place of the user i.e the place for which they want to know the weather. The app not only tells the place's temperature but also the current time. If the user is interested in learning more about the place then they can click on the INFO button which will open a wikipedia article regarding the 
city. 


*******New Addition********

 1)Now, not only can the user open a wiki page regarding the city, the app itself gives some Information about the city the user has searched for.
 
 2) Added favourite button on the dataPage so that the user can select their favourite location. This favourite location is displayed on the mainactivity. The user is allowed to remove the unfavorite a location and a message is displayed if all three spots of favourite location are taken in the mainactivity and none are unfavorited.
