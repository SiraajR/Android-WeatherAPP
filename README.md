# Android-WeatherAPP
This is code written in android Studio for my first android development app.
The app takes in the desired place of the user i.e the place for which they want to know the weather. The app not only tells the temperature of the place but also
tells the current time. If the user is interested in learning more about the place then they can click on the INFO button which will open a wikipedia article regarding the 
city.
