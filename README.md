# Android-WeatherAPP
This is code written in android Studio for my first android development app.
The app takes in the desired place of the user i.e the place for which they want to know the weather. The app not only tells the temperature of the place but also
tells the current time. If the user is interested in learning more about the place then they can click on the INFO button which will open a wikipedia article regarding the 
city. 
*******New Stuff********
Now not only can the user open a wiki page reagarding the city, the app it self gives some Information about the city the user has searched for.
